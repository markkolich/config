## It seems that using PEERDNS=yes was somehow telling dhclient to
## use the DNS servers provided by Comcast instead of the ones I
## really want to use as defined here.  Commenting out PEERNDS
## seems to have made things more reliable; at least the DNS servers
## I ~really~ want are added to /etc/resolv.conf more often than not.
